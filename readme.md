## FAQ

#### I selected a Rabbit, but a huge wolf came out to eat me, is this bugged?

No, it says that you need to be careful because sometimes YOU might be the prey, that wolf is trying to get a tasty meal, ya better run, or boop him on the nose!

#### What does magic damage do?

It bypasses armor, but it's very hard to get.  Only a few monsters have magic damage.

#### Are there bugs I should be aware of?

NOOOOO Silly!!! Those aren't bugs, they're features.  Our design crew (myself) has been tirelessly (except for when I get tired and sleep) working to provide the most fun in our games!  We want to give you the most!  And that means that we(I) don't REMOVE the bugs that you might otherwise enjoy! I leave those in, and don't judge what you're into!
